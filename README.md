In this project we worked with real estate data from Zillow. Specifically we focused on Average Mean Price for Chicago (monthly data).

Using different time series models, we try to compare and predict the changes on the Chicago housing market, which has a very strong seasonality.

In our analysis we used several different approaches:

* Exponential Smoothing

* sARIMA

* Regression with ARIMA errors

* Vector Autoregression (VAR)
